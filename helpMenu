Instructions to set up a Battleship game:

    1. Run setip.c to create shared memory and semaphore.
    2. Both your and the opponent's boards initially should be empty.
    3. Input coordinates to place ships on your own board.
    4. Now, you should be able to see your own ships under 'My Board'.
